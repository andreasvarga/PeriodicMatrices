## About

`PeriodicMatrices.jl` provides the basic tools to handle periodic time-varying matrices. 
The time dependence can be either continuous or discrete. 

A continuous-time periodic matrix can be specified in the following forms:

- periodic matrix function
- harmonic matrix series
- periodic matrix time series with uniform time grid 
- periodic matrix time series with non-uniform time grid
- periodic symbolic matrix
- Fourier matrix series approximation   

A discrete-time periodic matrix can be specified in the following forms:

- periodic matrix time series with time-varying dimensions with uniform time grid
- periodic matrix time series with time-varying dimesnions with non-uniform time grid
- periodic matrix time series with constant dimensions with uniform time grid
- periodic matrix time series with constant dimensions with non-uniform time grid

For a periodic matrix `A(t)` of period `T` it is not assumed that `T` is the minimum value
which satisfies the periodicity condition `A(t) = A(t+T)` for all values of `t`. To describe 
matrices having multiple periods, a subperiod `Tsub := T/n` can be defined, such that `A(t) = A(t+Tsub)`,
for all `t`. This allows a substantial memory saving for some classes of periodic representations. 
Moreover, all operations with periodic matrices allow different, but commensurate, periods/subperiods.
